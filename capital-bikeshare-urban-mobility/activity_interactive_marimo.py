    # Capital Bikeshare: Investigating Service Across Space and Time

    ## Your role and mission

    Imagine that **Capital Bikeshare has asked your team to examine 2025 trip data**.

    Your goal is to help Capital Bikeshare better understand how its service is currently being used. The insights you develop could help the organization review its service and consider how it might better serve the community.

    The data include information about where and when trips began and ended, rider and bike types, and trip duration.

    Begin by developing **one or more questions** that could help Capital Bikeshare learn something useful about its current service. As you learn more, you may refine, narrow, replace, or add questions.

    > **Your questions:** What would you like to investigate to help Capital Bikeshare understand its current service and better serve the community? Briefly explain why each question could be useful.

    You might consider space and location, time, rider type, bike type, trip duration, or relationships among these attributes.

    # Where the data come from

    Capital Bikeshare publishes monthly trip-history files for public analysis. These files contain trip timing, start and end stations, bike type, and rider category. The source files are much larger than needed for a short classroom investigation.

    For this module, we prepared a smaller dataset from four months in 2025: **January, April, July, and October**. Records unsuitable for the planned analyses were excluded, and a manageable subset of eligible trips was retained: 2,500 trips from January and 6,000 from each of the other three months. The resulting file contains 20,500 trips.

    This smaller dataset makes the notebook faster and easier to use in JupyterLite while preserving useful spatial and temporal patterns. Because the months contain different numbers of selected records, raw monthly totals should not be treated as complete monthly ridership.

    We also compared important characteristics of the smaller dataset with the eligible records and original source data to check that it remained suitable for learning. The figure below shows one example: January trip-duration distributions are broadly similar across the original, eligible, and classroom datasets. The purpose here is simply to show that validation was part of the preparation process; the technical details are not needed for this activity.

    ## Why we use a landmark dataset

    A map of station coordinates can be difficult to interpret without familiar geographic reference points. We therefore created a small companion dataset containing selected Washington, DC landmarks, such as Union Station, the U.S. Capitol, the White House, and major memorials and museums.

    The landmark names and coordinates were compiled from official public sources and stored in `data/dc_landmarks.csv`. The helper functions add these landmarks to central-Washington maps so students can orient themselves without relying on a live online map service. The landmark data provide context only; they are not used to calculate trip activity.
